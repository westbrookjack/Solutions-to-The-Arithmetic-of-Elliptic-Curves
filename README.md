# Solutions to *The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves*

This repository contains my in-depth notes and worked solutions to the textbook  
**_The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves_** by Joseph H. Silverman.

## ✨ Project Goals

- Expand and annotate **key theorems**, **remarks**, and **examples**
- Provide **rigorous proofs** and **commentary** to clarify core concepts
- Write **fully worked solutions** to exercises from every chapter
- Organize all material with LaTeX, using a consistent and navigable format

## 📁 Files

- `main.tex` — The master LaTeX file with all chapter content
- `references.bib` — Bibliography for citing external references
- *(Future additions:)* custom preamble, chapter-based macros, and PDF build instructions

## 🛠 Compilation

To build the PDF:

```bash
pdflatex main.tex
bibtex main
pdflatex main.tex
pdflatex main.tex
